###As a recent alumni from the University Of South Africa studying Bachelor of Science, I am
confident that I am well-prepared to be a valuable contributor to any company's growth and
success. Welcome to my platform!###

I am detail-oriented and meticulous when managing competing priorities within tight
deadlines. I work best in roles where utilizing coding allows me to make a positive impact
while using creative problem-solving to solve issues and achieve goals since I learnt a lot on
how to build certain projects using java, python, HTML, CSS and machine learning at the
software engineering boot camp in Hyperiondev . As an aspiring data scientist, my academic
strengths have greatly contributed to the development of my communication, decision-making,
and planning skills. I bring clear and effective communication to build professional
connections with co-workers, management, and customers.

Through my academic and freelancing journey I have also learned how to interact with
people in an organisation efficiently so at Provantage Media, where I assisted with all on-site computer and call-
centre systems to track sales and customer quieres, sold the benefits of products,did no cold
calling, listened to customer needs and identified opportunities, delivered awesome
services, drove sales in various campaigns for Levi's South Africa, Steri Stumpie, Vape and
Pharmton through activation's across Johannesburg and lastly handled and resolved all
queries and problems from clientâ€™s complaints to obtain a productive customer relations
platform for my team on all sales done monthly and I also applied a strong focus on building
my file management and documenting abilities.
